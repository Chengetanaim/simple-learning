# Simple Learning

Ever since the covid era, people have been migrating to doing things online.  But with the current boom in social apps such as Instagram and Tik Tok, most people now only think that
the internet is good for having fun, which is absolutely false.  With simple learning, we change the narrative that the internet is only used for the social media.
Simple learning is a platform to help programmers in solving any particular bugs that they are facing.  
It is more like stackoverflow, but it is specific to a language so a user can easily learn a language by viewing the most asked questions and reading the answers.
